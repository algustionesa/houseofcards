Simple landing page framework which doesn't scream "Look, i'm a bootstrap landing page like every other"

## Why?

The majority of landing pages looks pretty similar, and as the cost of whipping one up has come down to less than an hour, your project runs the risk of drowning in a sea of similar ones. For the user it becomes hard to discern if you put the sweat of months into your project or a half assed afternoon.

From a UX perspective, House of Cards tries to do everything to be perceived as different.

## Why the stack metaphor?

Beside of the slight tinder feel, there's a more important reason: If you ever worked at McKinsey et al, you'll know the ritual of nearly every meeting concluding with someone trying to sum it up on, at least an imaginary, PowerPoint deck. While that's easy to mock, it's also a great exercise:

**What is it you really want to communicate? In n uniform arguments ( = slides)?**

Tis forces you to really think about and condense your arguments, as opposed to segments with arbitrary length in the typical landing page.

## Technical details?

House of Cards doesn't have any external dependencies, uses global event event handlers and should be safe to use with any other libraries, frameworks or build tools.

## Status

We're working on a few mobile quiks but should be ready to use in early Feb 2015.
